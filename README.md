# Olimpia
OlimpiaAI is a lightweight neural network framework focused on privacy, control, and scalability. It supports local training, deep learning with CUDA, and is ready for .NET integration.

Local-first training and inference
Privacy-focused architecture
Middle learning and GPU-accelerated deep learning
Modular design with shared library core
By applying tokenization to break input into words or characters, encoding them using one-hot vectors, word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe, or custom vocabulary mappings, the data can be fed into a neural network and trained for tasks such as sentiment classification, next-word prediction, or intent recognition.
